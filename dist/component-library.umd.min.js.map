Can be used in place of `options.client`.\n * @param {boolean} [options.useDeferredClient] Used in conjunction with `authorization`, allows the Data Collector instance to be available right away by fetching the client configuration in the background. When this option is used, {@link GooglePayment#getDeviceData} must be used to collect the device data.\n * @param {boolean} [options.kount] Kount fraud data collection will occur if the merchant configuration has it enabled.\n * **Note:** the data sent to Kount is asynchronous and may not have completed by the time the data collector create call is complete. In most cases, this will not matter, but if you create the data collector instance and immediately navigate away from the page, the device information may fail to be sent to Kount.\n * @param {boolean} [options.paypal] *Deprecated:* PayPal fraud data collection will occur when the DataCollector instance is created.\n * @param {callback} [callback] The second argument, `data`, is the {@link DataCollector} instance.\n * @returns {(Promise|void)} Returns a promise that resolves the {@link DataCollector} instance if no callback is provided.\n */\nfunction create(options) {\n  var name = 'Data Collector';\n  var result = {\n    _instances: []\n  };\n  var data;\n\n  return basicComponentVerification.verify({\n    name: name,\n    client: options.client,\n    authorization: options.authorization\n  }).then(function () {\n    result._instantiatedWithAClient = !options.useDeferredClient;\n    result._createPromise = createDeferredClient.create({\n      authorization: options.authorization,\n      client: options.client,\n      debug: options.debug,\n      assetsUrl: createAssetsUrl.create(options.authorization),\n      name: name\n    }).then(function (client) {\n      var kountInstance;\n      var config = client.getConfiguration();\n\n      if (options.kount === true && config.gatewayConfiguration.kount) {\n        try {\n          kountInstance = kount.setup({\n            environment: config.gatewayConfiguration.environment,\n            merchantId: config.gatewayConfiguration.kount.kountMerchantId\n          });\n        } catch (err) {\n          return Promise.reject(new BraintreeError({\n            type: errors.DATA_COLLECTOR_KOUNT_ERROR.type,\n            code: errors.DATA_COLLECTOR_KOUNT_ERROR.code,\n            message: err.message\n          }));\n        }\n\n        data = kountInstance.deviceData;\n        result._instances.push(kountInstance);\n      } else {\n        data = {};\n      }\n\n      return Promise.resolve();\n    }).then(function () {\n      return fraudnet.setup().then(function (fraudnetInstance) {\n        if (fraudnetInstance) {\n          data.correlation_id = fraudnetInstance.sessionId; // eslint-disable-line camelcase\n          result._instances.push(fraudnetInstance);\n        }\n      });\n    }).then(function () {\n      if (result._instances.length === 0) {\n        // NEXT_MAJOR_VERSION either this should error with a specific error that\n        // no data collector instances could be set up, or we should just swallow\n        // the error and document that no device data will be returned if\n        // data collector cannot be instantiated.

For example, the array can look like `['01 - January', '02 - February', ...]`.\n * @property {number} [maxCardLength] This option applies only to the number field. Allows a limit to the length of the card number, even if the card brand may support numbers of a greater length. If the value passed is greater than the max length for a card brand, the smaller number of the 2 values will be used. For example, is `maxCardLength` is set to 16, but an American Express card is entered (which has a max card length of 15), a max card length of 15 will be used.\n * @property {number} [maxlength] This option applies only to the CVV and postal code fields. Will be used as the `maxlength` attribute of the input if it is less than the default. The primary use cases for the `maxlength` option are: limiting the length of the CVV input for CVV-only verifications when the card type is known and limiting the length of the postal code input when cards are coming from a known region.\n * @property {number} [minlength=3] This option applies only to the cvv and postal code fields. Will be used as the `minlength` attribute of the input.\n * For postal code fields, the default value is 3, representing the Icelandic postal code length. This option's primary use case is to increase the `minlength`, e.g. for US customers, the postal code `minlength` can be set to 5.\n * For cvv fields, the default value is 3. The `minlength` attribute only applies to integrations capturing a cvv without a number field.\n * @property {string} [prefill] A value to prefill the field with. For example, when creating an update card form, you can prefill the expiration date fields with the old expiration date data.\n * @property {boolean} [rejectUnsupportedCards=false] Deprecated since version 3.46.0, use `supportedCardBrands` instead. Only allow card types that your merchant account is able to process. Unsupported card types will invalidate the card form. e.g. if you only process Visa cards, a customer entering a American Express card would get an invalid card field. This can only be used for the `number` field.\n * @property {object} [supportedCardBrands] Override card brands that are supported by the card form. Pass `'card-brand-id': true` to override the default in the merchant configuration and enable a card brand. Pass `'card-brand-id': false` to disable a card brand. Unsupported card types will invalidate the card form. e.g. if you only process Visa cards, a customer entering an American Express card would get an invalid card field. This can only be used for the  `number` field. (Note: only allow card types that your merchant account is actually able to process.)\n *\n * Valid card brand ids are:\n * * visa\n * * mastercard\n * * american-express\n * * diners-club\n * * discover\n * * jcb\n * * union-pay\n * * maestro\n * * elo\n * * mir\n * * hiper\n * * hipercard\n */\n\n/**\n * An object that has {@link module:braintree-web/hosted-fields~field field objects} for each field.

This should be used with the `expirationYear` property.\n * @property {field} [expirationYear] A field for expiration year in `YYYY` or `YY` format. This should be used with the `expirationMonth` property.\n * @property {field} [cvv] A field for 3 or 4 digit card verification code (like CVV or CID).

This object looks similar to CSS. Typically, these styles involve fonts (such as `font-family` or `color`).\n *\n * You may also pass the name of a class on your site that contains the styles you would like to apply. The style properties will be automatically pulled off the class and applied to the Hosted Fields inputs. Note: this is recomended for `input` elements only. If using a `select` for the expiration date, unexpected styling may occur.\n *\n * These are the CSS properties that Hosted Fields supports.
