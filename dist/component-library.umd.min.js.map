If `placeholder` is not natively supported by the browser, it will be polyfilled.\n * @property {string} [type] Will be used as the `type` attribute of the input. To mask `cvv` input, for instance, `type: \"password\"` can be used.\n * @property {boolean} [formatInput=true] Enable or disable automatic formatting on this field.\n * @property {(object|boolean)} [maskInput=false] Enable or disable input masking when input is not focused. If set to `true` instead of an object, the defaults for the `maskInput` parameters will be used.\n * @property {string} [maskInput.character=•] The character to use when masking the input. The default character ('•') uses a unicode symbol, so the webpage must support UTF-8 characters when using the default.\n * @property {Boolean} [maskInput.showLastFour=false] Only applicable for the credit card field. Whether or not to show the last 4 digits of the card when masking.\n * @property {(object|boolean)} [select] If truthy, this field becomes a `<select>` dropdown list.

If the value passed is greater than the max length for a card brand, the smaller number of the 2 values will be used. For example, is `maxCardLength` is set to 16, but an American Express card is entered (which has a max card length of 15), a max card length of 15 will be used.\n * @property {number} [maxlength] This option applies only to the CVV and postal code fields. Will be used as the `maxlength` attribute of the input if it is less than the default. The primary use cases for the `maxlength` option are: limiting the length of the CVV input for CVV-only verifications when the card type is known and limiting the length of the postal code input when cards are coming from a known region.\n * @property {number} [minlength=3] This option applies only to the cvv and postal code fields. Will be used as the `minlength` attribute of the input.\n * For postal code fields, the default value is 3, representing the Icelandic postal code length. This option's primary use case is to increase the `minlength`, e.g. for US customers, the postal code `minlength` can be set to 5.\n * For cvv fields, the default value is 3. The `minlength` attribute only applies to integrations capturing a cvv without a number field.\n * @property {string} [prefill] A value to prefill the field with. For example, when creating an update card form, you can prefill the expiration date fields with the old expiration date data.\n * @property {boolean} [rejectUnsupportedCards=false] Deprecated since version 3.46.0, use `supportedCardBrands` instead. Only allow card types that your merchant account is able to process. Unsupported card types will invalidate the card form. e.g. if you only process Visa cards, a customer entering a American Express card would get an invalid card field. This can only be used for the `number` field.\n * @property {object} [supportedCardBrands] Override card brands that are supported by the card form. Pass `'card-brand-id': true` to override the default in the merchant configuration and enable a card brand. Pass `'card-brand-id': false` to disable a card brand. Unsupported card types will invalidate the card form. e.g. if you only process Visa cards, a customer entering an American Express card would get an invalid card field. This can only be used for the  `number` field. (Note: only allow card types that your merchant account is actually able to process.)\n *\n * Valid card brand ids are:\n * * visa\n * * mastercard\n * * american-express\n * * diners-club\n * * discover\n * * jcb\n * * union-pay\n * * maestro\n * * elo\n * * mir\n * * hiper\n * * hipercard\n */\n\n/**\n * An object that has {@link module:braintree-web/hosted-fields~field field objects} for each field.
